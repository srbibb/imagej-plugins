ImageJ plugins and setup. 

Sarah_Mitotic_Threshold: Identifies and crops images of 
mitotic cells in an image. The plugin processes a folder 
of images in either .ims or .tif format, and saves each 
cell as a cropped image in a chosen output folder.

ZProject_Folder: Z-projects each image in a folder of .ims images.
